edge-blending-shader-three.js
=============================

Projector blending shader for perfect edge blending in three.js as postprocessing shader.

I ported to Threejs the openframeworks addon done by Jeffrey Crouse ( https://github.com/Flightphase/ofxProjectorBlend). Three.js have if you combining using method "setViewOffset" from PerspectiveCamera (http://threejs.org/docs/#Reference/Cameras/PerspectiveCamera) it is super easy to make grid of screen rendering. 

This library was develop develop for Google Devart(http://devart.withgoogle.com/) commission project together 'Wishing wall' by Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Canet.
